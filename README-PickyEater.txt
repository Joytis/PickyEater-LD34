	Once upon a time, there was a rich and powerful king. He ruled over a vast kingdom,
boundless and plentiful, where the peasants were fat with meats, crops, and ale and the
lords were even fatter. . . 

	One fateful morning, as the king laid into his second breakfast, he couldn't help 
but notice how glorious his reign had become. The sun was peeking over the hills and 
valleys on the edge of his empire, and he thought his papa would be 
proud of the king he had become. He sighed, content, and happily gobbled down the last
of his red velvet cake. As he looked up to call the maid, he noticed something peculiar.
A hole, about the size of a cantaloupe, plopped into existence near his throne. Gripped by
a heavy fear of the unknown and unable to get up, he flailed about and cried for maid louder.
It was too late. No help was coming. Within moments, the king was consumed by the void. . . 

	Sometime later, the king awoke. He was in a throne room, and even though it resembled his
own, it was not. Something was off, and he did not like it. he crawled up onto the new throne,
confused, and waited grumpily for his servants to brief him on the situation. The king waited
for what felt like years before hearing a small knock on the chamber door. 

	"It is about time you came to give me a briefing! you ingrates need to learn how to serve 
the kin-- WHAHHH!!!!" the king flopped in horror as the supposed servant entered the room.
It was a colorful little creature, with small beety eyes, no hands, and a stupid look on 
its face. 

	"MEEP." said the creature.

	The king did not know how to react, so naturally he asserted his dominance. 

	"Hmph. Indeed, peasant. You know, you should really bow in the presence of royalty!"

	"MEEP?" the creature asked. The creature looked at the king confused as he gestured for it
to kneel."meep. . . ?" it bargained, as it slowly lowered itself to the floor. 

	"GOOD. Now bring me my mid-morning seconds-ies!"

	". . . haaa. . meep." it sighed in agreement and went out to fetch some food. There as a
problem, though. The Meep didn't know what fat, pasty, smelly things liked to eat. It asked
a few of its friends, and they didn't know what it was talking about, but it convinced them
to round up some food and bring it to the castle just in case the lard creature didn't like 
its first offering. . . 

	The thing with Meeps, though, is they have a LOT of friends. . . 


	You are a fat king who needs to eat fattening foods to show his dominance. Little creatures
called meeps are bringing you plenty of offerings, but be careful, because they are stupid
and don't know what you human types eat. Avoid poisoning yourself with the meeps offering of
salads, celery, and poison. You must get as fat as possible to bring the meeps into submission.
Fatty foods like pizza and cake will make you grow. Healthy foods like celery and carrots will
make you less fat. Poisonous foods like mushrooms will probably kill you. Be on the lookout for
super duper rare foods, because they are cool. WE LOVE YOU.
